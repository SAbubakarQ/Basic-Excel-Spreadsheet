## Basic-Excel-Spreadsheet
The Basic Excel Spreadsheet is a C++ code that functions as a simple spreadsheet. It has the following operations: store, randomize, minimum, maximum, average, summation, variance, standard deviation, print, and quit. 
* STORE (store) - Stores the user's written value into the desired cell.
* RANDOMIZE (Randomize) - Sets a random value within each cell between the user's number range and cells chosen. 
* MIN (Minimum) - Calculates the minimum value between two selected cells and stores it in the the user's desired cell.
* MAX (Maximum) - Calculates the maximum value between two selected cells and stores it in the the user's desired cell. 
* AVG (Average) - Calculates and stores the average value between two user chosen cells.
* SUM (Summation) - Adds up all the values between the two user's selected cells and stores it in the desired cell.
* VAR (Variance) - Calculates the variance amongs the cells chosen and stores the value in the user's desired cell. 
* STD (Standard Deviation) - Calculates the standard deviation between two desired cells and stores the value in the user's desired cell. 
* PRINT (Print) - Prints the excel sheet according to the user's input with its current values.
* QUIT (Quit) - Quits the program. 
* CMDList (Command List) - Displays the command list in the terminal window for no need of scrolling to the top to see the commands. 


A sample command would be "STORE 42 A1" which will store the value 42 in cell block A1. 

To view the value in the cell, "PRINT A1 B10" can be used to see values from A1 to B10 on the spreadsheet. 

  It will output:
  
  Enter desired operation: STORE 42 A1
  
  Enter desired operation: PRINT A1 B10
